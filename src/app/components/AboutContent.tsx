      <p>I&apos;m an expert full-stack engineer and serial entrepreneur who is passionate about creating meaningful interactive experiences.</p>
      <p>
        I had the good fortune to start, build and sell a highly successful startup in the tech space (Clover), which gave me a wealth of experiences.
        From building and marketing a revolutionary product, to hiring and leading a team of 20, I had an absolute blast learning and growing as an
        entrepreneur and creator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the sale of Clover, I&apos;ve had the privilege of founding more companies, creating more products, mentoring other entrepreneurs, and
        investing in meaningful startups.
      </p>
      <p>I love the intersection of technology and design, and I thrive creating user experiences that impact people in a practical way.</p>
